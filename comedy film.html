        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Comedy Film</b> is a movie that tries to make people laugh and feel happy. It often uses funny dialogues, jokes, misunderstandings, or silly actions to create humor. Unlike serious films, comedies usually have a light and relaxing atmosphere. Most of them end with a positive or cheerful conclusion, leaving the audience satisfied.</p>
        <h3><p style="font-weight: 400;">There are different types of comedy films. Romantic comedies mix love stories with humor, action comedies add exciting adventures with jokes, and dark comedies make fun of serious topics in a clever way. Comedy films are popular because they bring joy and reduce stress.</h2></p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Mr. Bean</i></b> is a classic British comedy starring <b>Rowan Atkinson</b>. The show is famous for its unique style of humor, where Mr. Bean rarely speaks but expresses everything through exaggerated facial expressions and funny actions. He often turns ordinary situations—like eating at a restaurant, taking an exam, or going on holiday—into chaotic and hilarious adventures. The comedy is simple, visual, and easy to understand, which makes it enjoyable for audiences of all ages. Because of this universal style, Mr. Bean has become popular worldwide and is often regarded as a modern version of silent comedy.</p>
