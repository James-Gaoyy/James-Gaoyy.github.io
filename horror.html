      <h1><center>HORROR FILMS</h1></center>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>horror films</b>are a type of movie aimed at creating terror. Their storylines are often absurd and bizarre, evoking fear. For instance, they might depict ghosts haunting people or fierce animals attacking humans. The development of cinematography has provided more favorable conditions for presenting terrifying scenes. Some so-called disaster films that exaggerate earthquakes and nuclear wars also fall into this category.</p>
        <h3><p style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, <i>horror films</i> are the style that is closest to the essence of the film art. Because films need to create suspense, only suspense can make the audience have a strong sense of anticipation. Horror films often aim to evoke the audience's primitive negative emotions such as fear, terror, unease and panic, and through the release of these emotions, the audience can obtain an entertainment experience. In horror films, there are often terrifying or disgusting monsters, evil animals or humans, supernatural ghosts and other images</h2></p>

        <h3><b>Directed by Hideo Nakata and Koji Suzuki, written by Hiroshi Takahashi, starring Nanako Matsushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Miki Nakatani</b></h3>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Ring</i></b>is about High school student Tomoko watches a videotape of unknown origin with her classmates. Seven days later, she and her classmates die. This attracts the attention of journalist Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), who decides to investigate. Learning that Tomoko was hospitalized after a shocking videotape, Asakawa finds the hotel that rents the videotape and rents the unnamed tape. Upon turning it on, the horrific scenes nearly bring Asakawa to a breaking point. Her ex-husband, Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada), arrives and copies the tape, deciding to research it with her. They have seven days to uncover the tape's secrets and survive.</p>
        <h2><b>Detailed plot</b></h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">1. Because her parents were out, Tomoko invited her classmate Yumi to her home. Tomoko told Yumi that she had watched a video said to be cursed. Just as the two thought it was a joke, the phone downstairs rang. But when they picked up the phone, they found it was a false alarm. It was just her parents saying they would be back very late. After Yumi went to the bathroom, Tomoko was drinking water in the kitchen. Suddenly, she turned her head and let out a scream.
        2. Journalist Reiko Asakawa was doing a program about mysterious video tapes. Out of curiosity, she checked the story told by the interviewee and found it was true. She asked her colleague to investigate the location of the incident. With a heavy heart, Reiko went home and took her son Yoichi to attend her cousin Tomoko's funeral.
        3. Reiko and Yoichi arrived at Tomoko's home. Reiko left Yoichi in the living room while she went to greet Tomoko's mother. Yoichi kept rubbing his forehead while looking at Tomoko's photo. Then he went upstairs to Tomoko's room alone. Reiko found Yoichi and was about to leave when she received a call from her colleague, who informed her of the schools of the two people who died because of the video tape.
        4. Reiko went to watch the video tape of the couple who died in the car. For some reason, their expressions when they died seemed to have seen something terrifying. Reiko went to Tomoko's home, and Tomoko's mother told her about the scene when she found Tomoko. Tomoko's expression was exactly the same as that of the couple. Then Reiko got Tomoko's travel photos, but she found that the faces of the deceased were covered with a layer of fog and were somewhat distorted. When she got home, Yoichi told Reiko that Tomoko had watched that video tape.
        5. Reiko went to the vacation house in Izu where Tomoko had lived and watched the video tape to investigate. However, she couldn't find the video tape in the house. Frustrated, Reiko went to the registration office to inquire and unexpectedly found a strange-looking video tape. The owner said it might have been left by a guest. Reiko took the video tape back to the vacation house.
        6. Reiko found that the video tape contained only some fragments, such as a volcanic eruption, a woman combing her hair, an eye with the character "贞" on it， and a well. There was no other content. But suddenly， Reiko noticed a white figure behind her in the TV screen. When she turned her head， there was no one there. At that moment， the phone rang. Just like those who died， there was only a noisy sound on the phone. Reiko asked her ex-husband Takayama for help.
        7. Takayama didn't believe what Reiko said. Reiko asked Takayama to take her photo. After taking the photo， they found that Reiko's face was blurred. Takayama finally believed her. After watching the video tape， the phone didn't ring. Later， Takayama saw a pair of white shoes on the street but found no one when he looked up. Reiko took a copy of the video tape to Takayama and told him that after investigation， no guest had left the video tape.
        8. While the two were studying the video tape， Takayama's student Takano arrived. Plus， some of the scenes were unclear， so they went to the TV station to study it. Takayama found that there was sound in one of the scenes and decided to investigate the sound.
        9. Takayama found the volcano mentioned in the video tape and went to investigate. Reiko took Yoichi to visit her father. At that time， Takayama told Reiko that a local woman had predicted the volcanic eruption but was regarded as a monster and committed suicide. After hearing this， Reiko fell asleep with a heavy heart. In the middle of the night， she woke up to Yoichi's voice and was horrified to find that Yoichi was watching the video tape.
        10. Yoichi told the horrified Reiko that it was Tomoko who asked him to watch it. To save Yoichi's life， Reiko decided to investigate with Takayama. On the way， Takayama told Reiko that the woman in the video tape， Shizuko， had met and married Dr. Iyokabe Hachiro because of her special abilities. But due to media ridicule， Shizuko went crazy and committed suicide. Dr. Iyokabe Hachiro also disappeared. They left a daughter named Sadako.</p>
