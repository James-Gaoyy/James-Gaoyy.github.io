        <h1><center>SCIENCE FICTION FILMS</h1></center>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Science fiction films</b> are a genre of movies that combine science with imagination. They often portray futuristic worlds, outer space, advanced technology, or alien life. Beyond stunning visual effects, sci-fi movies explore the relationship between humans, technology, nature, and the universe.</p>
        <h3><p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, <i>science fiction films</i> often inspire real scientific progress. Many inventions, such as smart devices or space exploration technologies, were once imagined in movies before becoming reality. This connection between imagination and innovation makes sci-fi not only entertaining but also an important cultural force shaping humanity’s vision of the future.</h2></p>

        <h3><b>Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine</b></h3>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Interstellar</i></b> is a science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. Set in a future where Earth is on the brink of collapse, humanity faces a severe survival crisis. Former pilot Cooper is chosen to lead a team of explorers on a journey through a wormhole, searching for a new home for mankind. The film combines breathtaking depictions of outer space with scientific concepts such as black holes, time dilation, and higher dimensions. At its heart, however, the story focuses on love, sacrifice, and hope—especially the powerful bond between Cooper and his daughter, Murphy. By blending advanced science with deep human emotion, Interstellar delivers not only stunning visuals but also profound reflections on humanity’s place in the universe. It is widely regarded as one of the most iconic science fiction films of modern times.</p>
